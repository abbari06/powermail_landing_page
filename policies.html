                You shall pay all fees for the powermail Services as specified in
                the billing section of the powermail Services, or Order Form, if
                applicable. Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or
                similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for
                example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes,
                assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever. You are responsible
                for paying all taxes associated with your purchases. You agree
                that your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any
                future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or
                written public comments made by us regarding future
                functionality or features. Promotion Restrictions You are free
                to promote your own websites, but naturally, any promotion that
                mentions powermail.io could be perceived by the public or the press
                as a joint effort. You should know that certain forms of
                advertising are always prohibited by powermail.io. For example,
                advertising commonly referred to as "spamming" is unacceptable
                to us and could cause damage to our name. Other generally
                prohibited forms of advertising include the use of unsolicited
                commercial email (UCE), postings to non-commercial newsgroups
                and cross-posting to multiple newsgroups at once. In addition,
                you may not advertise in any way that effectively conceals or
                misrepresents your identity, your domain name, or your return
                email address. You may use mailings to customers to promote
                powermail.io so long as the recipient is already a customer or
                subscriber of your services or website, and recipients have the
                option to remove themselves from future mailings. Also, you may
                post to newsgroups to promote powermail.io so long as the newsgroup
                specifically welcomes commercial messages. At all times, you
                must clearly represent yourself and your websites as independent
                from powermail.io. If it comes to our attention that you are
                spamming, we will consider that cause for immediate termination
                of your participation in the powermail Partner Program. Any pending
                balances owed to you will not be paid if your account is
                terminated due to such unacceptable advertising or solicitation.

                Affiliates utilizing Pay-Per-Click advertising campaigns, or any
                other digital advertising channel, whether in existence now or
                invented in the future, that bid on keywords such as powermail.io,
                powermail, powermailApp, and/or any misspellings or similar alterations
                of these – be it separately or in combination with other
                keywords – and do not direct the traffic from such campaigns to
                their own website prior to re-directing it to ours, will be
                considered trademark violators, and will be banned from the
                powermail Partner Program. We will do everything possible to contact
                the affiliate prior to the ban. However, we reserve the right to
                expel any trademark violator from our affiliate program without
                prior notice, and on the first occurrence of such PPC bidding
                behavior. While actively promoting powermail, you may not
                participate as an affiliate or partner with competing/adjacent
                products and brands, without explicit approval from powermail. If
                you are already an affiliate or partner with another
                organization and are unsure of whether or not it is
                competing/adjacent to powermail, please email us and we will advise.

                profits) damages, regardless of legal theory, whether or not
                powermail has been warned of the possibility of such damages, and
                even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose; (b) aggregate

                Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between powermail and you
                concerning the subject matter hereof, and they may only be
                modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized
                executive of powermail, or by the posting by powermail of a revised
                version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
                otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Website
                will be governed by the laws of the state of British Columbia,
                Canada, excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper
                venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the
                same will be the state and provisional courts located in
                Vancouver, Canada. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable
                relief or claims regarding intellectual property rights (which
                may be brought in any competent court without the posting of a
                bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally
                settled in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules
                of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”)
                by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such Rules.
                The arbitration shall take place in Vancouver, Canada, in the
                English language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in
                any court. The prevailing party in any action or proceeding to
                enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’
                fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or
                unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the
                parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain
                in full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term
                or condition of this Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one
                instance, will not waive such term or condition or any
                subsequent breach thereof. You may not assign your rights under
                this Agreement to any other party without powermail’s express
                written consent; powermail may assign its rights under this
                Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon
                and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors
                and permitted assigns.

                As an email service provider, we take spam law seriously, not
                only for our sake but for yours as well. Spam negatively impacts
                deliverability rates, and we want to make sure your emails reach
                their intended recipients as often as possible. We have some
                very strict rules that must be adhered to in all countries, but
                you may find that your country has additional requirements.
                Below you will find a list (conveniently ordered alphabetically)
                of countries with specific anti-spam legislation as well as our
                over-all rules to help maintain platform integrity. Requirements
                for All powermail Campaigns 1. You must agree to our Terms of
                Service. 2. We recommend including an opt-out link into your
                email templates and outreach campaigns for audiences you haven’t
                contacted previously. 3. You must include your contact
                information inside every email promotion* that you send,
                including a physical mailing address or PO Box where you can
                receive mail. (Not a website or email address.) * An email
                promotion is usually a broadcast with a low ratio of text to
                image area offering discounts or other incentives to purchase a
                product or service, or to subscribe, register, download or
                perform some other action intended to drive revenue for the
                vendor. 4. Your contact information and subject line must be
                100% accurate. 5. If you regularly use an integrated service or
                CRM platform, you need to abide by their terms of use, in
                addition to our own. 6. It is strongly recommended that your
                emails comply with the US CAN-SPAM Act. If you break the rules,
                you could be liable for hundreds of dollars for each recipient
                that you sent non-compliant messages to. 7. In addition to
                CAN-SPAM rules, you must comply with the anti-spam laws of the
                countries your recipients live in. So if you're sending to EU
                residents and US residents, check the EU spam laws to make sure
                you're also EU compliant.
